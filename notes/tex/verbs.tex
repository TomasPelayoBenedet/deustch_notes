\section{Verbs}\label{sec:verbs}

In this section, we will explore how verb conjugation works in German, looking at its systematic patterns and rules. Understanding the German verb system is a crucial step in mastering this language, as it differs from English in several important ways, particularly in its structured approach to verb endings and tenses.

In declarative sentences, the verb ALWAYS goes in the second position. E.g.:

\begin{center}
    Ich \textbf{gehe} am Montag mit Pedro ins Stadium

    Am Montag \textbf{gehe} ich mit Pedro ins Stadium
\end{center}
